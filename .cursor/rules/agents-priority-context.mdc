description: Always prioritize the agent contract + indexes as first context for any prompt
---

# Always-on agent context (read first)

## Intent

For **any** user prompt (regardless of files touched), treat the following as **highest-priority context** and read/consider them first:

- `.agents/agents.md`
- `.agents/README.md`
- `.agents/roles/README.md`
- `.agents/skills/README.md`
- `openspec/config.yaml`

## Operating rule

- If these files are not already present in the active context window, **load them immediately** (use the editor/tools to read them) before deciding how to respond.
- Apply their routing/guardrails before any other repo conventions.
- The orchestrator in `.agents/agents.md` is **delegate-only** — it never executes phase work directly. It delegates to sub-agents via the Task tool.
