description: Always prioritize the agent contract + indexes as first context for any prompt
---

# Always-on agent context (read first)

## Intent

For **any** user prompt (regardless of files touched), treat the following as **highest-priority context** and read/consider them first:

- `agents/agents.md`
- `agents/README.md`
- `agents/roles/README.md`
- `agents/skills/README.md`

## Operating rule

- If these files are not already present in the active context window, **load them immediately** (use the editor/tools to read them) before deciding how to respond.
- Apply their routing/guardrails before any other repo conventions.
