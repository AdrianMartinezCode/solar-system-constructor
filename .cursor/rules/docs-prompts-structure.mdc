description: Task prompt storage convention: per slug + per task subfolder under docs/prompts/

# `docs/prompts/` structure rule (keep prompts unmixed)

## Goal

Avoid mixing unrelated task prompts in a single flat folder. Every change initiative (slug) gets its own folder, and every task gets its own subfolder so you can attach additional context files later without clutter.

## Canonical layout

- `docs/prompts/<slug>/`
  - `task_<n>/`
    - `TASK_<n>_<slug>.md` (the task prompt)
    - _(optional)_ `NOTES.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, screenshots, scratchpads, etc.

Where:
- `<slug>` is the same snake_case slug used in `CR_<slug>.md` / `PLAN_<slug>.md`
- `<n>` is 1-indexed (`1`, `2`, `3`, …)

## Naming rules

- Use `task_<n>` (e.g. `task_1`, `task_2`), not free-form folder names.
- Keep the prompt filename as `TASK_<n>_<slug>.md` to preserve grep-ability and consistency.

## Do / Don’t

- Do: create `docs/prompts/<slug>/task_<n>/TASK_<n>_<slug>.md`
- Don’t: create new prompts directly under `docs/prompts/` root.
