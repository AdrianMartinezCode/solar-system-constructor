# Agent Roles

Agent roles are “personas” with a well-defined responsibility boundary. They all follow the global contract in `agents/agents.md`.

## Available Roles

- **Curator of Order**: `curator_of_order.md` — repository librarian/refactoring scalpel; keeps docs/agents/decisions organized and entropy low.
